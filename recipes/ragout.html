        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, sliced</li>    
        <li>1 cup mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes and brown them on all sides. Remove the beef and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add the chopped onion and garlic. Sauté until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots, celery, and mushrooms.             Cook for about 5 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.</li>
        <li>Pour in the red wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the pot. Add the beef broth, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, thyme, and rosemary. Stir to combine.</li     >
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the flavors are well combined.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot with crusty bread or over mashed potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
